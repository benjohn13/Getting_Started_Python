== Getting Started with Python Programming ==

Notes from learning to program with Python. A computer is a logically malleable device. While it can be an unforgiving, literal machine,
it can be explicitly instructed (programmed) to do almost anything. Python is a robust programming language capable of such a task, and
provides an array of functionality utilized globally.

One of the reasons Python is so great is because it is “Platform Independent”. Meaning you can write Python code once, then ship it out to 
any platform that you want it to execute on knowing that it will execute on that platform well. You don't have to refactor your code every 
time you want to ship it out to a new environment, which is useful for scaling in a global environment.

Python is also legible. It takes little effort for a novice of the language to look at the code and have some idea of what its doing or 
how it works. Because of its user friendly syntax, it is a popular language among programmers and brings with it a broad community of 
support. There are many libraries open to the public that are continuously being built on by developers, and a host of utilities available 
to use through the Python Package Index.

== Let's Begin ==

If you are running a Windows machine, you will want to go to https://www.python.org to download the program version compatible with your 
machine. If you are running on Linux or Mac, Python is already included in your OS. Another cool feature Python supports is the mode in 
which you program; Normal and Interactive. Normal mode is used for building ".py" files, which will be executed on your machine. While 
Interactive mode allows you to execute the code you have entered immediately in a Python terminal and see the output of your results. 
Interactive mode is great for testing and highly recommended.

If you would like to verify that Python is installed on your Linux or Mac machine, you can open your terminal (CLI) and enter the 
following commands:

python -v

or

python --version

Moving forward, I will be writing/testing Python on my Windows computer, utlizing the Python terminal that was downloaded from the site 
listed above. README files will be provided to document the general information of the code, but the goal of this repository is to 
demonstrate working knowledge of Python through programming efficiently and legibly. Thank you for reading and I hope you find these 
projects enjoyable.
