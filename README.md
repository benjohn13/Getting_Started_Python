# Getting_Started_Python
The basics of of Python as I have learned them. 

== Variables ==
Variables allow you to assign and store value for a given piece of information. They are implicitly declared and strong-typed. Here some
of the basic strong-typed variables you can store in your program. 

- Numeric
- String
- List 
- Tuple
- Dictionary

The pieces of code in "/Variables" will be executed each line top to bottom, and assign the value on the left side of equal sign
(assignment operator) to the variable on the right side of the operator.
